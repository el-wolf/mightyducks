              IHF Law 1 provides for flexible external field dimensions within
              a given maximum and minimum width and length. These dimensions
              should be adhered to for all fields used by teams under 12 and
              older.

              Fields used within the competition program must be a minimum of
              100 x 60 yards.Leagues, districts or associations participating
              in the state competition program that are unable to provide a
              field that meets these minimum requirements must advise the
              State Competition Board which will assign its Fields Committee
              to inspect the field and recommend to the Board whether or not a
              waiver of the minimum dimensions should be granted. Teams from
              leagues, districts or associations that are unable to provide an
              acceptable field may be required to play all their games away.
